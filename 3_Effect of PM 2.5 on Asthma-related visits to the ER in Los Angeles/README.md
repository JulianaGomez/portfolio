# Effect of PM 2.5 on Asthma-related visits to the ER in Los Angeles

Project developed for the Statistics, as part of my Masters in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. Asthma affects citizens of all ages and genders. The financial cost of asthma exceeds $81 billion annually and is responsible for over 3,500 deaths annually in the United States^[Perez MF, Coutinho MT. An Overview of Health Disparities in Asthma. Yale J Biol Med. 2021 Sep 30;94(3):497-507. PMID: 34602887; PMCID: PMC8461584.]. Notably, in 2019-2020, Los Angeles County had a 15.1\% prevalence of asthma, meaning 1.4 million residents are affected by asthma^[California Asthma Dashboard. (2020). Environmental Health Investigations Branch. California Department of Public Health.]. While there have been studies done to find associations of asthma prevalence and exacerbation with air pollution, analysing data from Los Angeles County could help identify the major cause of asthma in the county, thus providing direction for policymakers to improve the well-being of their constituents, particulary “low-income communities, communities of color, tribal nations and other disadvantaged groups who continue to be overburdened by unacceptable levels of pollution”^[Blumenfeld, J. Zeise, L. (2021) CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Report.] and children^[McConnell R, et al. (2010). Childhood incident asthma and traffic-related air pollution at home and school. Environ Health Perspect 118(7):1021-6]. This study uses linear regression analysis to estimate the effect of air pollution on the rate of asthma in Los Angeles County.
