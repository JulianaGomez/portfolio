The following files shows the pipeline used to analyze land cover data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, and Afrobarometer data for East African countries. The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between land cover and gender issues in East Africa. Given the time constraints for this project, the full analysis was not carried out. However, the csv files for the years 2020-2022, so the pipeline is available for future use.

## Methodology
1. Download desired rasters from Copernicus Land Monitoring Service.
2. Georeferenced coordinates from cities in the Afrobarometer data.
3. Clip rasters to desired area, using georeferenced coordinates. 
4. Convert rasters to dataframes.
5. Merge dataframes.
6. Output as csv and netcd (in case we want to use clipped maps in QGIS).
7. Load into R and analyze.

## Land Cover data
Land cover classification gridded maps derived from satellite observations were downloaded from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, for the years 2016-2022. However, because of time constraints, only the last 3 years were sliced to the countries of interest and converted to csv. However, all files (2016-2022) will be included as deliverables of this project as zip files, for future use. 

This dataset characterizes the land cover of a particular year. The land cover was derived from the analysis of satellite data time series of the full period. The land cover classification is based on the LCCS (Land Cover Classification System) and consists of 22 classes.

The dataset is in csv format, under the folder `csv`. Files can be read using `readr` in R, with the read_csv function.


## Variables of interest
Here are the following variables of interest in the dataset:

|Name	|Units	|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Change count	|Dimensionless|	Number of years where land cover class changes have occurred, since 1992. 0 for stable, greater than 0 for changes.|
|Current pixel state	|Dimensionless|	Pixel identification from satellite surface reflectance observations, mainly distinguishing between land, water, and snow/ice. Six values are used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; respectively meaning: clear land, clear water, clear snow ice, cloud, cloud shadow, filled.|
|Land cover class|	Dimensionless|	Land cover class per pixel, according to a legend of 22 classes, defined using the Land Cover Classification System developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Distinct values are encoded as unsigned byte (0..255). The complete legend is available in the NetCDF files metadata and in the Product User Guide documentation.|
|Observation count	|Dimensionless|	Number of valid satellite observations that have contributed to each pixel's classification|
|Processed flag	|Dimensionless.|	Flag to mark areas that could not be classified. Two values are used: 0, 1; respectively meaning: not_processed, processed.|

More information on the dataset can be found at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview

Additional data from previous attemps at a pipeline can be found in the `Older` folder of this project.


## Afrobarometer data
The 2019 Afrobarometer data was analyzed in the `afrobarometer_analysis.Rmd` notebook, in the `r` folder of this project. See said notebook for summary statistics.  

The 2022 Afrobarometer data was downloaded, and variables of interest (related to gender) were selected. See `afrobarometer_2022_analysis.Rmd` for variables of interest. 

Ideally, each of the land cover files should be joined to the georef file, based on latitude and longitude, so they can then be joined by city name to the Afrobarometer data. Because of time constraints of the project, this step was not carried out. See the `clip_based_on_georef.ipynb` notebook for more information.
